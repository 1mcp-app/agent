## Overview

1MCP (One MCP) is designed to simplify the way you work with AI assistants. Instead of configuring multiple MCP servers for different clients (Claude Desktop, Cherry Studio, Cursor, Roo Code, Claude, etc.), 1MCP provides a single, unified server.

## Features

- **üîÑ Unified Interface**: Aggregates multiple MCP servers into one
- **üîí OAuth 2.1 Authentication**: Production-ready security with scope-based authorization
- **‚ö° High Performance**: Efficient request forwarding with proper error handling
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security First**: Stdio transport isolation, input sanitization, and comprehensive audit logging
- **üîß Easy Configuration**: Single JSON configuration file with hot-reload support
- **üìà Health Monitoring**: Built-in health check endpoints for monitoring and observability

## Quick Start

### 1. Install 1MCP

**Binary (Recommended - No Node.js Required):**

```bash
# Linux/macOS
curl -L https://github.com/1mcp-app/agent/releases/latest/download/1mcp-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar -xz
sudo mv 1mcp /usr/local/bin/

# Windows (PowerShell)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/1mcp-app/agent/releases/latest/download/1mcp-win32-x64.zip" -OutFile "1mcp.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "1mcp.zip" -DestinationPath "."
```

**NPM:**

```bash
npx -y @1mcp/agent --help
```

### 2. Add MCP Servers

```bash
1mcp mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
1mcp mcp add filesystem -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem ~/Documents
```

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
1mcp
```

### 4. Connect Your AI Assistant

**For Cursor**, add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "1mcp": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3050/mcp?app=cursor"
    }
  }
}
```

**For VSCode**, add to `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "1mcp": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3050/mcp?app=vscode"
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add -t http 1mcp "http://127.0.0.1:3050/mcp?app=claude-code"
```

That's it! All your MCP servers are now available through one unified endpoint. üéâ

## Commands

## How It Works

1MCP acts as a proxy, managing and aggregating multiple MCP servers. It starts and stops these servers as subprocesses and forwards requests from AI assistants to the appropriate server. This architecture allows for a single point of entry for all MCP traffic, simplifying management and reducing overhead.
