# 1MCP System Architecture

> **Vision**: A unified, reliable proxy that makes multiple MCP servers appear as one, simplifying AI assistant integration while maintaining security and performance.

## üéØ Purpose & Context

**Problem**: AI assistants need to connect to multiple MCP servers, but managing dozens of individual connections is complex, unreliable, and security-intensive.

**Solution**: 1MCP acts as a unified proxy/multiplexer that aggregates multiple MCP servers behind a single, reliable interface.

**Success Metrics**:

- **Reliability**: Stable operation with proper error handling
- **Performance**: Efficient request forwarding to backend servers
- **Security**: OAuth 2.1 authentication and secure defaults
- **Simplicity**: Single configuration file, easy deployment

## üìè System Constraints

### **Hard Constraints**

- **Single Binary**: Must deploy as one executable, no external dependencies
- **MCP Protocol**: Must be 100% compatible with MCP [Latest specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest)
- **Stdio Transport**: Backend servers communicate via stdio or streamable http (security boundary)
- **Configuration**: All config via single JSON file, hot-reloadable

### **Soft Constraints**

- **Concurrent Connections**: Handle multiple simultaneous client connections
- **Backend Servers**: Support multiple MCP servers per instance
- **Network**: Works behind corporate firewalls (HTTP/SSE only)
- **Startup Time**: Fast startup for development iterations
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies for security

### **Why These Constraints**

- **Single Binary**: Enterprise deployment requirement - no complex setup
- **Multi-Transport**: Backend servers support stdio, HTTP, and streamable HTTP transports
- **Hot Reload**: Zero-downtime configuration updates required

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Principles

### **Principle 1: Reliability Over Performance**

- System must stay operational even if individual backends fail
- Graceful degradation preferred over fast failure
- Connection management with retry logic and timeouts

### **Principle 2: Security by Default**

- All endpoints require authentication unless explicitly disabled
- Backend servers run in isolated processes with secure transport protocols
- Input sanitization on all external data
- No sensitive data in logs

### **Principle 3: Simplicity Over Flexibility**

- Single deployment model, not configurable
- Convention over configuration where possible
- Explicit rather than implicit behavior

### **Principle 4: Transparency to Clients**

- MCP protocol compliance - clients don't know it's a proxy
- Error messages preserve backend server context
- No protocol modifications or extensions

## üîÑ Decision Framework

When evaluating new features or changes, ask:

### **Reliability Questions**

- Does this reduce system availability?
- What happens if this component fails?
- Can the system continue operating without it?

### **Security Questions**

- Does this expand the attack surface?
- Could this leak sensitive information?
- Are we maintaining defense in depth?

### **Simplicity Questions**

- Does this add configuration complexity?
- Will this make deployment harder?
- Can we solve this with existing patterns?

### **Compatibility Questions**

- Does this break MCP protocol compliance?
- Will existing clients continue to work?
- Are we preserving backend server interfaces?

## üìä Quality Attribute Scenarios

### **Reliability Scenario**

- **Situation**: Backend MCP server crashes during request processing
- **Response**: System detects failure, marks server unavailable, retries request on other servers if applicable
- **Measure**: <5 second recovery, client receives appropriate error, system remains available
- **Current**: Connection pooling with health checks, exponential backoff retry

### **Security Scenario**

- **Situation**: Client attempts to access MCP server without proper authorization
- **Response**: OAuth token validation, scope checking, request denied with 403
- **Measure**: Zero unauthorized access, all attempts logged with client context
- **Current**: OAuth 2.1 with scope-based authorization, session management

### **Performance Scenario**

- **Situation**: Multiple concurrent clients making requests to backend servers
- **Response**: Efficient request forwarding, proper error handling, async processing
- **Measure**: Reliable request processing, system remains responsive
- **Current**: Express.js with proper error handling, async request forwarding

### **Maintainability Scenario**

- **Situation**: New MCP server added to configuration file
- **Response**: Hot reload detects change, spawns new server process, updates routing
- **Measure**: <30 seconds to become available, zero downtime
- **Current**: File system watching with debounced reload, graceful process management

## üö´ System Boundaries & Anti-Patterns

### **What We Are**

- **MCP Protocol Proxy**: Faithful implementation of MCP specification
- **Authentication Gateway**: OAuth 2.1 security layer
- **Connection Multiplexer**: Many clients to many servers
- **Process Manager**: Lifecycle management for backend servers

### **What We Are NOT**

- **Business Logic Engine**: No data transformation or business rules
- **Caching Layer**: Every request goes to backend (for now)
- **Service Mesh**: Not a general-purpose service communication layer
- **Database**: No persistent storage of application data

### **Integration Boundaries**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "North Bound (Clients)"
        NB[HTTP/SSE + OAuth<br/>MCP Protocol Only]
    end

    subgraph "1MCP Core"
        C[Proxy Logic]
    end

    subgraph "South Bound (Backends)"
        SB[Backend MCP Servers<br/>stdio/HTTP transports]
    end

    subgraph "East/West (Peers)"
        EW[No service-to-service<br/>communication]
    end

    NB --> C
    C --> SB
    C -.- EW
```

### **Anti-Patterns We Avoid**

- **Shared Database**: No shared state between instances
- **Network Dependencies**: No calls to external services at runtime
- **Protocol Extensions**: No MCP protocol modifications
- **Synchronous Chains**: No blocking calls in request path
- **Global State**: All state is request-scoped or configuration

## üó∫Ô∏è Evolution Strategy

### **Phase 1: Single Instance Proxy** (Current)

- **Scope**: One 1MCP instance per deployment
- **Features**: HTTP/SSE transport, OAuth, basic connection pooling
- **Constraints**: No horizontal scaling, local configuration only

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Features** (Future)

- **Scope**: Additional operational features based on user feedback
- **Features**: Enhanced monitoring, advanced configuration options
- **Migration**: Backward compatible, optional enhancements

### **Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities** (Future)

- **Scope**: Advanced features for enterprise use cases
- **Features**: Enhanced security, operational improvements
- **Migration**: Configuration extensions, no protocol changes

### **Evolution Principles**

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing deployments continue working
- **Progressive Enhancement**: New features are opt-in
- **Zero Downtime**: All migrations support hot upgrades
- **Configuration Driven**: Features enabled through configuration

## ‚ö° Architecture Validation

### **Automated Architecture Testing**

```typescript
// Example: Architecture tests enforce our boundaries
describe('Architecture Constraints', () => {
  test('No business logic in transport layer', () => {
    // Static analysis ensures transport only handles HTTP/auth
  });

  test('All external calls use circuit breakers', () => {
    // Validate resilience patterns are used
  });

  test('No direct database access outside repositories', () => {
    // Enforce data access patterns
  });
});
```

### **Architecture Metrics**
