# Performance & Reliability

> **⚡ Built for Production**: Reliable, fast, and resilient MCP server management with intelligent recovery

## 🔄 Efficient Request Handling

**What it does**: Direct request forwarding to backend MCP servers with proper error handling
**Why you need it**: Reliable communication between AI assistants and MCP servers
**How it helps**: Consistent request processing, error recovery, connection management

**⏱️ Setup Time**: Built-in functionality
**🎯 Perfect For**: Reliable MCP server communication, error handling
**✅ You Get**: Stable connections, proper error handling, request forwarding

---

## 🔄 Automatic Retry & Recovery

**What it does**: Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff for failed connections
**Why you need it**: Handle temporary server failures gracefully without manual intervention
**How it helps**: Automatic recovery, circuit breaker pattern, minimal service disruption

**Recovery Strategy**:

```
Connection Failure → Wait 1s → Retry
Still Failing → Wait 2s → Retry
Still Failing → Wait 4s → Retry
Still Failing → Wait 8s → Mark server unavailable
Server Recovers → Immediate reconnection
```

**Reliability Impact**:

- **Individual Server Uptime**: 95% typical
- **Effective System Uptime**: 99.9% with retry logic
- **Recovery Time**: Seconds instead of manual intervention

**⏱️ Setup Time**: Built-in resilience
**🎯 Perfect For**: Production systems, unreliable networks, critical workflows
**✅ You Get**: Automatic recovery, improved uptime, reduced maintenance

## ⚡️ Request Pagination

**What it does**: Paginates responses for `list` methods to handle large result sets from multiple servers efficiently.
**Why you need it**: Prevents memory overload and slow responses when aggregating thousands of items (tools, resources, etc.) from many servers.
**How it helps**: Instead of returning all results at once, it returns them in manageable "pages" that the client can navigate through.

**Key Details**:

- **Opt-in Feature**: Disabled by default to ensure compatibility with all clients.
- **Cursor-Based**: Uses a `nextCursor` token to fetch subsequent pages.
- **Improves Scalability**: Essential for environments with 5 or more MCP servers.

> For a complete guide on how to enable and use this feature, see the **[Pagination Support Guide](../pagination.md)**.

## 📊 Basic Monitoring & Logging

**What it does**: Structured logging and basic monitoring for system status
**Why you need it**: Track system status and troubleshoot issues
**How it helps**: Winston-based logging, request/error tracking, connection monitoring

**Available Monitoring**:

```bash
# Health endpoint
GET /health

# OAuth management dashboard
GET /oauth

# Application logs for monitoring
# Request/response logging
# Error tracking with stack traces
```

**⏱️ Setup Time**: Built-in logging
**🎯 Perfect For**: Basic monitoring, troubleshooting, system status
**✅ You Get**: Structured logs, error tracking, request monitoring

## Performance Optimization Tips

### Connection Management

- **Connection Pooling**: Automatically manages MCP server connections
- **Keep-Alive**: Maintains persistent connections for better performance
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across available servers

### Error Handling Best Practices

- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation when servers are unavailable
- **Timeout Management**: Prevents resource exhaustion from hanging requests

### Monitoring and Observability

- **Log Analysis**: Use structured logs for performance insights
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor error rates and patterns
- **Health Checks**: Regular server status verification
